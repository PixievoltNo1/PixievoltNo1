### ðŸ’– A lovable cuddly web nerd here to help YOU!

I'm a queer web developer who cares a lot about crafting fantastic User eXperiences! I have a [personal website](https://pixievoltno1.com/) I'm very proud of~ I'd love to make a living at this Web stuff by getting hired as a Frontend or Full-Stack Web Developer or Browser Extension Developer (remote or San Francisco Bay Area), but I'm also accepting commissions for individuals who just want their own dream Firefox/Chrome extension on [my Ko-Fi Services page](https://pixievoltno1.com/).
